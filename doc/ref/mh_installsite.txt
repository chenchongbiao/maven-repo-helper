    -V --version: show the version
    -p<package> --package=<package>: name of the Debian package which will contain the site file
    -e<version>, --set-version=<version>: set the version for the POM, do not use the version declared in the POM file.
    -r<rules> --rules=<rules>: path to the file containing the rules to apply when cleaning the POM.

    -n --no-act: don't actually do anything, just print the results
