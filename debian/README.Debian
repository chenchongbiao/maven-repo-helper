This package contains some essential tools for building Debian packages where
upstream uses Maven as its build tool, or where upstream uses another build
tool (Ant...) but you want to deploy the jars into the Debian Maven repository
at /usr/share/maven-repo with the necessary metadata - in Maven terms, POM
files - and make them available to other projects.

A tutorial is available at /usr/share/doc/maven-repo-helper/tutorial.html
